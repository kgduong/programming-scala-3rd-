class Equality {
  //Collections library uses a uniform approach to equality and hashing
  //  - First, divide collections into sets, maps, and sequences. Different collections are always unequal
  //  - Does not matter in equality where a collection is immutable/mutable
  //  - Element order matters in cases of Sequences, but doesn't in Maps and Sets
