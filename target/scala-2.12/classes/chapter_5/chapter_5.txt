Chapter 5: Types in Scala
    - majority of types are similar to Java types
    - Integral types and numeric types
    - Besides string which is a member of Java, all other types are members of scala class
    - Because Scala's basic types have same range as Java types, Scala value types can be compiled into Java primitive byte code
